    Attributes
    ---------
    fname :  str
        the name of the PDF file in following format (func_name - alignemnt - degree of alignment - sample)
        The parameters are separated by hyphens.
    path : str
        path of the directory to access the angular distribution file (default current working directory)

    Methods
    -------
    load()
        loads the angular distribution file form the given path location
    save()
        saves the sampled angular distribution function into the given path file
    sample()
        samples an angular distribution by calling object class ExpSimPDF
